                      <p>The William F. Slagle Dental Meeting, formerly named the MidSouth Dental Congress, is one of the College of Dentistry's greatest traditions. We are celebrating an historic milestone during the Slagle Meeting in March 2015, - Our 20th Anniversary! The MidSouth Dental Congress was implemented in 1995 as a means to promote quality care by providing the dental team with an exceptional education opportunity. In accordance with this mission, this meeting is committed to offering extensive continuing education courses, commercial exhibits, and additional educational programs advancing the growth and development of the dental profession.</p>
                    <p>The Planning Committee, the Dentistry Alumni Association, and the UT College of Dentistry have worked diligently to present the 2015 program that honors the legacy of this meeting and celebrates everything we have accomplished in the past two decades by bringing back the "best of the best" in continuing education speakers. The 2015 program also includes hands-on courses, expanded programming for the entire dental office staff and a Key Note Address from Connie Podesta.</p>
                  <p>In the past twenty years, more than $2 million in proceeds from this meeting have been donated directly to the College of Dentistry. That is one intangible you do not get from other continuing education programs. Your participation at the William F. Slagle Dental Meeting and Dentistry Alumni Weekend helps enhance the dental school experience for current and future students.</p>
                <p>On behalf of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center College of Dentistry Alumni Association and the William F. Slagle Dental Meeting Planning Committee, I would like to extend our warmest greetings to you, and thank you for your participation in this exciting 20th Anniversary Meeting.</p>
                <p>We look forward to seeing you in Memphis! </p>
                <p>Warmest Regards, <br />
                	Jeannie Beauchamp, DDS <br />
                President, Dentistry Alumni Association Board of Trustees</p>
