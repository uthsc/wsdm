                                        <p>Applying Adult Learning and Lifelong Education in the Clinical Context: How to Interact with Patients and Clinical Students Effectively.</p>
                                        <h5>Session Description</h5>
                                        <p>Dental professionals interact with clients daily, and often times train and interact with students in the clinical setting. The purpose of this session is to provide the audience with some strategies for developing and sustaining effective relationships with adult clients and clinical students in the clinical context based on adult learning theories. First, this session will present a brief overview of adult learning theories. Then, this session will provide an opportunity for the audience to critically reflect on their role in their workplace or clinical setting using a lifeline exercise. After that, this session will provide the audience with some opportunities to share their life experiences in groups using what they learned about the theories that were addressed previously. The session will conclude with discussions on some applicable strategies for dental professionals to use in their own practices to help them be able to build effective relationships with clients and clinical students and ensure their interactions produce the right amount of respect and dignity needed to inspire lifelong learners.</p>

                                    AND YES, GOLD AND PFM ARE STILL ALIVE”</h5>
                                    <p>Duration: 30 minutes, Breakfast & Learn session</p>
                                    <p>“Doc, I don’t want metal crowns in my mouth” – CHECK. Or, “Doc, can you please give me an all-white crown that doesn’t break” – CHECK AGAIN. We can please many patients now in this very demanding age of “white smiles”, including the reliable restoration of their posterior teeth with all-ceramic materials. IPS e.max and BruxZir are great and still undergoing changes and improvements. Monolithic zirconia is being mixed with glass or lithium disilicate to create beautiful and very strong FDPs. But how about when crowns (now called Fixed Dental Prostheses or FDPs) have to serve attached or overlying partials (now called Partial Removable Dental Prostheses or PRDPs)? Gold and PFM FDPs are still perfect for those situations. This brief fixed prosthodontic update will review the “single crown” preparation and cementation guidelines taught at UTHSC. It will also include a critical review of the strength, wear and esthetics of newer ceramic materials.</p>
