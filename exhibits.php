									<p>As chair, and on behalf of the Exhibits Committee for the William F Slagle Dental Meeting 2015, we invite you to participate in the exhibit display during our 20th anniversary meeting March 6-8, 2015. We had a highly successful conference in 2014 and we have great expectations for the 2015 meeting.</p>
									<p>The William F Slagle Dental Meeting will be held March 6-8, 2015 in Memphis, Tennessee, at the Hilton Memphis Hotel located at 939 Ridge Lake Boulevard. The exhibit convention services will set up booths on Thursday morning, March 5th; exhibitors will set up displays Thursday afternoon beginning at 1:00 PM and will need to be completed with booth assembly by 4:30 PM. The Exhibit Hall will open for display during the William F Slagle Dental Meeting on Friday morning, March 6th at 7:30 AM and close at 6:00 PM. Exhibitors will reopen for display on Saturday morning, March 7th beginning at 7:30 AM and will conclude at 2:00 PM. Booth takedown will begin promptly thereafter.</p>
									<p>Should you wish to participate, <a href="documents/exhibitor-contract.pdf">a contract is available <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i></a> for you to print, complete and return with a check for $700.00 made payable to the UT/William F Slagle Dental Meeting. We have an early bird special for those vendors who register and pay in full by November 30, 2014. Early bird registration is $650.00. If you are a vendor who needs a bigger space than an 8'x 6'x 6' booth, please consider renting two booths. This would increase your space size for vendors with large pieces of equipment to display. Hotel reservations can be made by calling the Hilton Memphis Hotel at telephone number 901-684-6664. Please peruse <a href="corporate-sponsorship-guidelines.php">the sponsorship information and consider becoming an event sponsor</a> at the 2015 meeting. Sponsorship at the level of $2500 and above will include complimentary exhibit booth space.</p>
								<p>Also on-line is <a href="documents/electrical-exhibit-request.pdf">an electrical form to complete if you have need for electricity <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i></a> and <a href="documents/credit-card-authorization-form.pdf">a credit card authorization form <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i></a>. Please note we can only accept Discover, MasterCard or Visa. As always checks are accepted. Return the completed form(s) with the contract and payment to Diane S. Weber, 875 Union Avenue, Room C209E, Memphis, TN 38163. We look forward to seeing you at our twentieth William F Slagle Dental Meeting.</p>
