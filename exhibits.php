                        available <i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i></a> for you to print, complete and return with a
                        check for $700.00 made payable to the UT/William F. Slagle Dental Meeting. We have an early bird
                        special for those vendors who register and pay in full by January 1st, 2017. Early bird
                        registration is $650.00. If you are a vendor who needs a bigger space than an 8'x 8'x 6' booth,
                        please consider renting two booths. This would increase your space size for vendors with large
                        pieces of equipment to display. Hotel reservations can be made by calling the Hilton Memphis
                        Hotel at telephone number (901) 684-6664. Please peruse <a
