                        <p>On behalf of the University of Tennessee College of Dentistry Alumni Association I want to
                            invite you to join us for the 2018 William F. Slagle Dental Meeting. Your Alumni Association
                            Board and the College of Dentistry staff have planned an outstanding meeting. Bring your
                            staff and learn from outstanding, nationally recognized speakers.</p>
                        <p>In addition, you’ll have the opportunity to participate in hands on courses, team building
                            and re-certify in all the required annual and bi-annual courses needed for licensure. It is
                            the goal of the Slagle Dental Meeting to provide you the very best and most cost effective
                            continuing education. In addition, the proceeds from the meeting are given back to the
                            College of Dentistry to further support the faculty and students. The meeting has
                            contributed over two million dollars back to our school!</p>
                        <p>If this is a reunion year, contact you classmates and encourage them to join you. The Alumni
                            Association plans dinners for you, so all you and your classmates need to do is show up!</p>
                        <p>Be sure and plan to attend our welcome party at the new Graceland facility, surrounded by
                            Elvis’s cars, and his legendary music.</p>
                        <p>The remodel of the school is now complete. It is truly state of the art! Plan to go by. Say
                            Hello to your favorite faculty member and thank him or her for all they taught you. You’ll
                            be very proud of the quality education that our students continue to receive.</p>
                        <p>I look forward to seeing you in Memphis and encourage you to participate in your Alumni
                            Association!</p>
