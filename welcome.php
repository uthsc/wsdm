                        <p>The William F. Slagle Dental Meeting, formerly named the MidSouth Dental Congress, is one of the College of Dentistry's greatest traditions. The inaugural meeting was held in 1995 to promote quality care by providing the dental team with an exceptional education opportunity. Continuing this mission, the Slagle Dental Meeting is committed to offering extensive continuing education courses, commercial exhibits, and additional educational programs advancing the growth and development of the dental profession.</p>
                        <p>The Planning Committee, the Dentistry Alumni Association, and the UT College of Dentistry have worked diligently to present a 2016 program that honors the meeting's legacy with the highest caliber continuing education speakers. The program also includes hands-on courses and expanded programming for the entire dental office staff.</p>
                        <p>Throughout its history, the meeting has provided more than $2 million in proceeds  directly to the College of Dentistry â€“ a benefit you do not get from other continuing education programs. Your participation at the Slagle Dental Meeting and Dentistry Alumni Weekend helps enhance the dental school experience for current and future students.</p>
                        <p>On behalf of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center College of Dentistry Alumni Association and the planning committee, I extend our warmest greetings to you and thank you for your participation in this exciting event.</p>
                        <p>We look forward to seeing you in Memphis!</p>
                        <p>Warmest Regards,<br />
                        Paul McCord, DDS '78<br />
